# ➤ Zen of Javascript

- Build functionality, not architecture.
- Build small things that work
  and glue them together to make big things.
- Clear is better than clever,
  but graceful beats both.
- Comments are good, even if you're Dutch.
- Asychronous is better than synchronous
  except for when it isn't
  but your code should work on both.
  -Convention is better than definition,
  if you have good docs.
  -Keep it loose, but build good tests.
